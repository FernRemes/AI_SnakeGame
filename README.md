# AI Snake Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where a snake moves around a confined area, eating food to grow longer. Players control the snake's direction to avoid collisions with itself or the boundaries. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging. The objective is to score as many points as possible before the snake collides with itself or the walls, ending the game.
